## Introduction

\*\*AI Code Review Assistant is an AI-powered tool designed to analyze GitHub pull requests and provide insightful feedback on code quality, best practices, and potential issues. The bot utilizes multiple AI models, including OpenAI's GPT-4o and Hugging Face's Mistral model, to generate meaningful suggestions that help developers improve their code efficiently.

## Features

- üöÄ AI-Powered Code Review: Analyzes provided GitHub PRs and offers AI-driven insights.
- üìñ **Best Practices Analysis**: Highlights readability and maintainability concerns.
- üîç **Potential Issue Detection**: Identifies possible code issues before merging.
- üåê **Minimal API Integration**: Built with ASP.NET 8 Minimal API for high performance.
- üíª **Blazor UI**: User-friendly web interface for PR analysis.
- ü§ñ **Multiple AI Models**: Supports both OpenAI and Hugging Face's Mistral model for flexibility and cost efficiency.

```

## Configuration

Replace API keys in `appsettings.json` as needed.

```json
{
  "GitHub": {
    "Token": "your-github-token"
  },
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "your-api-key"
  },
  "HuggingFaceApi": {
    "ApiKey": "your-api-key"
  }
}
```

### GitHub Token Permissions

To use this application, you need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with the following permissions:

- **Pull requests**: Access level - **Read and write**
- **Issues**: Access level - **Read and write**

These permissions are essential to allow the bot to add comments to pull requests and interact with issues.

To create a token with these permissions:

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Fine-grained tokens ‚Üí Generate new token
2. Set an appropriate token name and expiration
3. Select the repositories you want the bot to have access to
4. Under "Repository permissions", find:
   - "Pull requests" and set it to "Read and write"
   - "Issues" and set it to "Read and write"
5. Generate the token and copy it to your `appsettings.json` file

**Note**: Keep your GitHub token secure and never commit it to version control.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to your branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a Pull Request.
