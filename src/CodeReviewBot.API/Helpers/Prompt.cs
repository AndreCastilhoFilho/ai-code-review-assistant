                                                    Where:
                                                    - FILE must be exactly '{0}'
                                                    - LINE must be the line number being commented (use only lines that appear in the diff)

                                                    Important:
                                                    - Analyze ONLY the modified code that appears in the diff
                                                    - Use exactly the filename provided above
                                                    - Make only relevant and specific comments about the modified code
                                                    - Always indicate the exact line of code being commented
                                                    - If commenting on a code block, use the first line of the block
                                                    - Avoid generic comments or comments that don't point to a specific issue
                                                    - Provide practical suggestions on how to resolve the identified issue

                                                    Provide only the comments, without additional text.";
